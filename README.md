# ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork
Convolution Neural Network is a deep learning model which the machine learnig by selecting a group of pixels is called pooling 
Max-pooling selects the maximum of the values in the input feature map region of each step and average-pooling the average value of the values in the region. The output in each step is therefore a single scalar, resulting in significant size reduction in output size

In this notebook we have created 2 models of CNN. One with Max pooling and another without max pooling
and defining the structure

Finally fitting both models and comparing its loss
